# Jamments-front
As said in introduction:

> There's no script to include, no automatic DOM injection, no default CSS to customize, you're in full control.

Still, this is also obviously more work for you. To ease some of these tasks, let me introduce [Jamments-front](https://github.com/Buzut/jamments-front) a small front-end library that you can use. It will help you with the CRUD tasks.

You can install it via npm and require it using ES Module `import`. Take a look at the [dedicated documentation](https://buzut.github.io/jamments-front/) to know more.
